TDD Pair Programming exercise to create coin changer kata in Ruby

The coin change kata exercise should produce the minimal amount of change for a given amount

For instance, If the input is: 99 pence of a pound, the output should be: one 50 pence piece, two 20 pence pieces, one 5 pence piece, and two 2 pieces
The output can be something as simple as `50, 20, 20, 5, 2, 2` which is the same as 99 pence

The currency unit that we will use, will be 1 pence, instead of 1 pound
